Dictionary:


//CaribbeanTranAnalysis//

Tools: SQL, Spark, AWS ubuntu, Trifacta Wrangler

Data Wrangling: Created applicable and efficient database and designed schema, and linked dimensional tables by keys; accessed to data via AWS S3; cleaned the imported data by removing or altering values by SQL for further analysis

Transaction analysis: Used Spark via AWS Ubuntu cluster to describe and formed correlation to analyze the relationship between transaction behaviors with product types or GDP performance, to explain the trend; plotted trend and distribution with Spark


//Opioid_V1//

Data Wrangling: Substituted or removed the missing values with defined functions, and fixed state abbreviations by python

Statistic Test: Plotted histogram to discover claim counts trend in each state to visualize claims distribution; tested correlation
to check relationship between claim count with GDP, employment rate, annual payroll and factors by Python, to realize Linear Regression and Random Forest prediction models with variable importance

Machine Learning: Applied linear regression, random forest and neural network to check variable importance with H2O

Heatmap: Geocoded zip code with R Zipcode package and python API with AWS for exact latitude and longitude, developed heatmap with user interactive RShiny Web Application, and imported geocoded data to Tableau for better visualization


//DatabaseCreating//

Languages: SQL

Process: Designed schema and created the database, with altering, deleting and updating functions.


//TweetsAnalysis//

Languages: SQL, Spark

Analysis: Analysis the popular properties among tweeters, such as languages or countries.


//YelpAnalysis//

Languages: Python, SQL

Analysis: The first stage is to get the general distribution of people and restaurants from Yelp.json file, to check the most popular areas for specific kinds of restaurants; the second is to view customers' comments, giving owners an idea on the critical factors that can improve their popularity, such as service, parking or more beek.
